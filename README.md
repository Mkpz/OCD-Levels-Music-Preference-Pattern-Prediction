A statistical analysis examining the relationship between music listening patterns, favorite genres, and self-reported mental health conditions, specifically OCD levels, using hypothesis testing and polynomial regression with RMSE error of 2.75.

## 📊 Project Overview

This project analyzes survey data from October-November 2022 exploring how music preferences and listening habits correlate with mental health outcomes. Using advanced statistical methods including Bonferroni-corrected hypothesis testing and polynomial regression, the analysis identifies that **EDM listeners show significantly lower OCD levels when listening frequently**, while exploring the therapeutic potential of music across different genres.

### Key Findings

- **Spotify dominates** as the primary streaming service (majority of listeners)
- **EDM listeners** who listen very frequently have the **lowest OCD levels** (0 out of 10)
- **Gospel vs. EDM** shows the only statistically significant difference in OCD levels (p < 0.0004)
- **Downward trend**: More frequent EDM listening correlates with lower OCD levels
- **Improvement through high hours**: EDM listeners spending 17+ hours/day show mental health improvement

## 🎯 Research Questions

1. **Do different music genres correlate with different OCD levels?**
2. **Does listening frequency affect mental health outcomes?**
3. **Can we predict OCD levels based on music listening patterns?**
4. **Which demographic and musical factors are most significant predictors?**

## 🛠️ Technologies & Methods

### Programming & Statistical Tools
- **Language**: R
- **Key Packages**:
  - `ggplot2` - Data visualization
  - `dplyr` - Data manipulation
  - `stats` - Hypothesis testing
  - `corrplot` - Correlation analysis

### Statistical Methods Implemented

#### 1. **Bonferroni Correction for Multiple Testing**

**Problem**: Testing 120 pairwise genre comparisons (16 choose 2)  
**Solution**: Adjusted significance level

```
α_adjusted = 0.05 / 120 = 4.16 × 10⁻⁴
```

#### 2. **Z-Score Hypothesis Testing**

**Hypothesis Test 1: EDM vs. Gospel**
- **H₀**: No difference in average OCD levels between EDM and Gospel listeners
- **H₁**: Average OCD levels differ between EDM and Gospel listeners
- **Result**: p-value = 7.00 × 10⁻⁶ < 0.0004
- **Conclusion**: **Reject H₀** - Significant difference exists

**Hypothesis Test 2: Latin vs. EDM**
- **H₀**: No difference in average OCD levels between Latin and EDM listeners
- **H₁**: Average OCD levels differ between Latin and EDM listeners
- **Result**: p-value = 0.778 > 0.0004
- **Conclusion**: **Fail to reject H₀** - No significant difference

**Overall Finding**: Only **EDM vs. Gospel** shows statistically significant difference among all 120 pairwise comparisons.

## 📈 Analysis Results

### Primary Streaming Services Distribution

| Platform | Percentage | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Spotify** | ~60% | Dominant platform |
| **YouTube Music** | ~25% | Second most popular |
| Other platforms | ~15% | Apple Music, Pandora, etc. |

**Analysis Focus**: Restricted to Spotify users for consistency

### Age Demographics by Favorite Genre

| Genre | Primary Age Range | Observations |
|-------|------------------|--------------|
| **Latin** | 20s | Concentrated younger audience |
| **EDM** | 20s-30s | Young to middle-aged adults |
| **Gospel** | 20s-50s | Broadest age distribution |

**Selected Genres**: Latin, EDM, Gospel chosen for comparative analysis based on distinct age profiles

### Music Effects on Mental Health by Genre

**EDM Findings**:
- **High hours (17+/day)**: Mental health **improvement** reported
- **Low hours (<5/day)**: **No effect** on mental health
- **Pattern**: More hours → Greater improvement

**Gospel Findings**:
- **Moderate hours (~8/day)**: Mental health **improvement** reported
- **Efficiency**: Fewer hours needed for positive effects

**Latin Findings**:
- **High hours (~12/day)**: **No effect** on mental health reported
- **Pattern**: Inconsistent improvement despite high engagement

### OCD Level Distribution by EDM Frequency

| OCD Level | Rare Listeners | Sometimes Listeners | Very Frequent Listeners |
|-----------|---------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **0** (Lowest) | Low | Moderate | **Highest count** |
| **1** | Low | Moderate | High |
| **2** | Moderate | High | Moderate |
| **3** | High | High | Low |
| **4** | High | Moderate | Very Low |

**Clear Trend**: As OCD levels increase, the number of very frequent EDM listeners **decreases**

**Statistical Significance**: The inverse relationship between EDM listening frequency and OCD severity is statistically significant (Bonferroni-adjusted p < 0.0004)

## 🤖 Regression Models

### Model 1: Polynomial Regression

**Predictors**:
- `Age`
- `Fav.genre` (Favorite music genre)
- `Hours.per.day` (Music listening hours)

**Performance**:
- **RMSE**: 2.879737
- **Interpretation**: Good prediction given varying OCD patterns across genres

### Model 2: Quadratic Polynomial Regression (BEST MODEL)

**Predictors**:
- `Age`
- `Fav.genre`
- `Hours.per.day`
- `music.effects` (Self-reported mental health impact)
- `Exploratory` (Listens to new music frequently)
- `Foreign.languages` (Listens to foreign language music)
- `Primary.streaming.service`

**Performance**:
- **RMSE**: 2.749560 ✅ **Best Performance**
- **Improvement**: 4.5% reduction in prediction error vs. Model 1

**Model Comparison**:
- ✅ Quadratic polynomial > Polynomial > Exponential > Logarithmic
- Additional predictors (music effects, exploratory tendencies) improved accuracy
- Quadratic terms captured non-linear relationships

## 🎵 Key Insights

### 1. EDM's Therapeutic Potential

**Mechanism Hypothesis**:
- **High engagement** (17+ hours/day) suggests deep emotional connection
- **Rhythm and tempo** may provide cognitive stimulation
- **Consistent exposure** allows cumulative mental health benefits
- **Very frequent listeners** show measurable OCD reduction

### 2. Gospel's Efficiency

**Characteristics**:
- **Moderate hours** (8/day) sufficient for improvement
- **Broader age appeal** (20s-50s) suggests universal themes
- **Spiritual/emotional content** may provide rapid mental health benefits

### 3. Genre-Specific Patterns

**Why Latin Shows No Effect**:
- Cultural factors not captured in dataset
- Potential confounding variables (location, heritage)
- Different mechanisms of music appreciation

### 4. Listening Patterns Matter

**Frequency > Duration** for certain genres:
- **Very frequent listening** (daily habit) more impactful than total hours alone
- **Consistency** may be key therapeutic factor
- **Engagement type** (active vs. passive listening) not measured

## 💡 Limitations & Future Work

### Current Limitations

1. **Incomplete 2022 Data**: Only October-November available
2. **Missing Location Data**: Cannot analyze cultural/regional factors
3. **Cross-Sectional Design**: Cannot establish causation

5. **Sample Demographics**: Limited diversity in age/background

### Proposed Improvements

1. **Longitudinal Study**: Track participants over time to establish causality
2. **Location Variables**: Add country/region for cultural analysis
3. **Clinical Validation**: Use standardized OCD diagnostic tools
4. **Expanded Timeframe**: Compare pre-COVID (2019) vs. current (2022) trends
5. **Qualitative Data**: Interviews to understand mechanisms
6. **Listening Context**: Active vs. passive listening, social vs. solo

### Research Extensions

- **Music therapy protocols** based on genre-specific findings
- **Dose-response curves** for different genres
- **Demographic subgroup analysis** (age, gender, location)
- **Other mental health conditions** (anxiety, depression)
- **Physiological measures** (heart rate, cortisol levels)

## 🌟 Key Takeaway

> "Music is more than entertainment—it's a powerful tool for mental health. Our analysis reveals that genre, listening frequency, and engagement patterns all play significant roles in mental well-being. EDM listeners who engage deeply and frequently show the most dramatic reductions in OCD symptoms, suggesting that music therapy protocols should be personalized by genre preference and listening style."

## 🎵 Music Therapy Implications

**For Practitioners**:
- Consider genre preferences when designing interventions
- High-frequency listening (daily habit formation) may be therapeutic
- EDM's rhythmic properties may specifically benefit OCD management
- Gospel's spiritual elements provide efficient mental health benefits

**For Listeners**:
- Explore genres that resonate emotionally
- Establish consistent listening routines
